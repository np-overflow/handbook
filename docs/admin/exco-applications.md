At Overflow, we look for people that can contribute to the club in a meaningful way. We want to make sure that you are a good fit for the club, and that the club is a good fit for you.

This means, as much as possible, we will make the interview process as transparent as possible. We value your time put into the interview process, and we want to make sure that you are able to make an informed decision on whether you want to join the club.

## Application Process

The application process is split into two parts:

1. Application form
2. Take home task (if applicable)
3. Interview with current EXCO and lecturer in charge

Throughout the process, you will be assessed based on challenges we encounter daily. These are realistic scenarios that you will face as an EXCO member. We won't ask brainteaser or trick questions.

### Application form

Submit your application through the form above. We will reach out ASAP and provide more details regarding your take home task.

### Take home task (if applicable)

The take home task is assigned by the current EXCO to gauge your ability for the position you've applied for.

!!! tip "Don't worry"

    The tasks that are set are not brain teasers, and are able to be done by everyone.

### Interview

The interview meant to be an informal way for us to understand you better, and for you to clarify any queries you might have about the club.

Interviews usually last **20 - 30 mins** and will cover the following:

1. **Introduction (5 mins)**
  
    Briefly introduce yourself (i.e. your interests in relation to the role)

2. **Personal showcase (10 mins)**

    This is your time to showcase your proudest or most significant projects / achievements. If you have any relevant experience, it's good to bring that up too! We prefer depth over breath, so it is okay to only showcase just 1 or even 2 projects, but go deeper into the details.

    What you showcase does not necessarily have to be related to the role. It also could be an incident or event that you felt you managed exceptionally well (i.e. your soft skills).

3. **Open Q&A (10 mins)**

    This gives us the opportunity to understand you better. We assess based on the AICV values outlined [here](https://open.gov.sg/careers/aicv).

    You are also encouraged to ask any questions about how Overflow operates, or any queries you might have here.

## Post-interview

After your interview, take a break! You've done well so far, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
