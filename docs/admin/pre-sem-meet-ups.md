# Pre-semester committee meet ups

## Brainstorming

Most workshop topics come from a brainstorming session during one of the meet ups.

> *But how do you think of things to teach?*

Brainstorming is a lot easier said than done, here are some general tips:

### 1. It can be anything

A workshop topic can be anything[^1] !

* Have you been working on something interesting over the holidays?
* Did you see an exciting new web framework?
* Your friend introduced you to something called *Infrastructure as Code*?

These are some possible guiding questions you can ask yourself. During the meet up, don't be afraid to bring up
anything that comes up in your mind - there's no harm.

### 2. You don't have to be familiar with the topic

A common *misconception or worry* when brainstorming is that you might not be familiar enough with the topic to teach
it, and that's totally natural.

A workshop is as much of a learning experience for the teaching team as it as for the
Overflow members. This is why most workshops are planned *at least 2 weeks in advance*, so there's ample time for the
teaching team to familiarize themselves with the content.

The content covered also doesn't have to be complete, or go deep into the topic. Sometimes, a high level overview is
enough!
