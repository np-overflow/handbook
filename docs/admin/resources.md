# Resources

## Communication

- WhatsApp: Used for batch chat groups prior to 2023 for announcements and chat groups for communication between the EXCO. Where applicable, direct messages are discouraged.
- Telegram: Used for batch chat groups since 2023 for announcements.
- Microsoft Teams: Used internally within the EXCO for communication (e.g., meetings) and for some Overflow events.

!!! info

    There are several teams created for Overflow work; note which one is current:
    `NP Overflow EXCO + Workgroup` is meant for use by the EXCO, `Overflow` is meant for all members, and Overflow Exco is deprecated.

- Discord: Used as the primary announcement channel for all Overflow batches. Also used to share workshop resources and to have conversations within Overflow members. Ocassionally used to host workshops or bootcamps.

!!! warning "Help"

    Users with the `EXCO` role on Discord should have access to EXCO channels.

!!! info

    We intend to make use of Discord more.
    Within the EXCO, in most scenarios, using our Discord server is preferred for discussions.

    See [here](/proposals/discord).

## Files

- [SharePoint](https://connectnpedu.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/np-overflow/Shared%20Documents/General?csf=1&web=1&e=gxYuNE): Used as the primary location of all Overflow documents, including planning docs, lesson slides, and admin content. See the [Storing changes in SharePoint](#storing-files-in-sharepoint) section for more details.
- [Handbook](https://handbook.np-overflow.club): Used as the primary location of noting how things are run within Overflow.

## Task management

- Notion: Used as the primary location for coordinating tasks, getting a bird's eye view of Overflow, and plan resources.

## Technology

- [GitHub](https://github.com/np-overflow): Used to store source code and host Overflow's projects. Contact the Head of Technology or P/VP for access.
  - Renovatebot: Used within the Overflow org to keep dependencies up to date.
- Cloudflare: Used for DNS (controlling the `np-overflow.club` domain), CDN, and static site hosting. Contact the P/VP for access.
- Netlify: Used for Overflow's [OGP image generator](https://github.com/np-overflow/og). Use Cloudflare Pages where possible for hosting instead.
- Fly.io: Used to host back-end code or servers.
- Namecheap: The domain registrar of `np-overflow.club`. Historical, and should be moved to Cloudflare when available and possible in the future.

## Publicity

- Canva: Used to create publicity materials to be pushed out on announcement channels.
- Illustrator: Used to create publicity materials to be pushed out on announcement channels.

## Storing files in SharePoint

We use SharePoint sites that are attached to the Microsoft Team's Teams above (i.e each Team has is its own SharePoint site).

!!! danger "Important"

    Please store files in the `NP Overflow EXCO + Workgroup` SharePoint site.

You should use SharePoint to store files that are:

- Highly collaborative (e.g. presentations, documents)
- Advanced access control requirements (e.g. limited to non-IT students)
- Requires the Microsoft productivity suite (e.g. `.docx`, `.pptx`)

#### Access control

As mentioned, the SharePoint site is associated with the `np-overflow` team, and by default, all members of the `np-overflow` team will be able to access all files on the SharePoint site.

While Microsoft Teams interface does not offer access-control capabilities, the associated SharePoint interface can be used to implement these features. The following guidelines should be used:

- In Microsoft Teams, the P/VPs should be owners
- EXCO members should be associated with the role "NP Overflow EXCO"
- Work group members should be associated with the role "NP Overflow Work Group"
- Roles can be created as needed, i.e. certain events require more specific restrictions, but their need should be carefully considered before creation. As much as possible, please aim to limit access ==as little as possible==, and be open with the team.
