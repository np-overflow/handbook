## Communication

### WhatsApp

*WhatsApp* groups are used to announce important information to the entire team.

### Discord

*Discord* is occasionally used to host workshops / bootcamps and for engaging with the Overflow community.

!!! warning "Help"

    Users with the `EXCO` role on Discord should have access to EXCO channels

!!! info

    We intend to make use of Discord more. 
    Within the EXCO, in most scenarios, using our *Discord* server is preferred for discussions.

    See [here](/proposals/discord).

### Microsoft Teams

*Microsoft Teams* is also used for workshops / bootcamps, as well as internal meetings.

This is largely because Microsoft Teams supports recording meetings.

These are the Teams channels we have:

* `np-overflow` (EXCO)
* `Overflow` (all members)
* `Overflow Exco` (deprecated)

## SharePoint

We use SharePoint sites that are attached to the Microsoft Team's Teams above (i.e each Team has is its own SharePoint
site).

!!! danger "Important"

    Please store files in the `np-overflow` SharePoint site.

You should use SharePoint to store files that are:

* Highly collaborative (e.g. presentations, documents)
* Advanced access control requirements (e.g. limited to non-IT students)
* Requires the Microsoft productivity suite (e.g. `.docx`, `.pptx`)

## GitHub

We use GitHub to share source code, and to host our projects.
