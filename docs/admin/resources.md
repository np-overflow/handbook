# Resources

## Communication

- WhatsApp: Used for batch chat groups prior to 2023 for announcements and chat groups for communication between the EXCO. Where applicable, direct messages are discouraged.
- Telegram: Used for batch chat groups since 2023 for announcements.
- Microsoft Teams: Used internally within the EXCO for communication (e.g., meetings) and for some Overflow events.

!!! warning "Important"

    There are several Teams created for Overflow work.

    **NP Overflow EXCO + Workgroup** is meant for use by the EXCO and contains the SharePoint site that contains all of Overflow's documents, including planning docs, lesson slides, and admin content. Treat the data in this Team as classified to the EXCO and other authorised parties unless otherwise stated.

    The **Overflow** Team is meant for use by the general Overflow members. Post-COVID era, it's not used as much, but if any workshops were to be done virtually (whether a fully online workshop or a hybrid workshop), this Team would be used to have the meeting for the workshops.

- Discord: Used as the primary announcement channel for all Overflow batches. Also used to share workshop resources and to have conversations within Overflow members. Ocassionally used to host workshops or bootcamps.

!!! info

    We intend to make use of Discord more. Within the EXCO, in most scenarios, using our Discord server is preferred for discussions. See [here](/proposals/discord).

## Files

- [SharePoint](https://connectnpedu.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/np-overflow/Shared%20Documents/General?csf=1&web=1&e=gxYuNE): Used as the primary location of all Overflow documents, including planning docs, lesson slides, and admin content. See the [Storing changes in SharePoint](#storing-files-in-sharepoint) section for more details.
- [Handbook](https://handbook.np-overflow.club): Used as the primary location of noting how things are run within Overflow.

## Task management

- Notion: Used as the primary location for coordinating tasks, getting a bird's eye view of Overflow, and plan resources.

## Technology

- [GitHub](https://github.com/np-overflow): Used to store source code and host Overflow's projects. Contact the Head of Technology or P/VP for access.
  - Renovatebot: Used within the Overflow org to keep dependencies up to date.
- Cloudflare: Used for DNS (controlling the `np-overflow.club` domain), CDN, and static site hosting. Contact the P/VP for access.
- Netlify: Used for Overflow's [OGP image generator](https://github.com/np-overflow/og). Use Cloudflare Pages where possible for hosting instead.
- Fly.io: Used to host back-end code or servers.
- Namecheap: The domain registrar of `np-overflow.club`. Historical, and should be moved to Cloudflare when available and possible in the future.
- Bitwarden: Used to store credentials across the team. Ownership of the organisation will rotate between the incoming and outgoing Presidents per EXCO batch due to the restrictions imposed by Bitwarden.

## Publicity

- Canva: Used to create publicity materials to be pushed out on announcement channels.
- Illustrator: Used to create publicity materials to be pushed out on announcement channels.
- Instagram: Used to communicate to the public about Overflow events.

## Storing files in SharePoint

We use SharePoint sites that are attached to the Teams above (i.e, each Team has is its own SharePoint site).

!!! warning "Important"

    Please store files in the `NP Overflow EXCO + Workgroup` SharePoint site. Treat the data within this site as confidential to the EXCO and other authorised parties unless otherwise stated. Before creating and sharing files, please look through the ["Access control" guidelines](/admin/access-control).

You should use SharePoint to store files that:

- Are highly collaborative (e.g., presentations, documents)
- Require advanced access control requirements (e.g. limited to non-IT students)
- Require the Microsoft productivity suite (e.g. `.docx`, `.pptx`)
