# Get started

Proposals are recommended to follow the SBAR format (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation).

Any proposal should have a status, driver, approver, and contributors. The driver is highly recommended to show a POC in
the recommendation section.

A template is provided below:

```md title="proposal.md"
# Your proposal

| Status  | Driver        | Approver | Contributors  |
|---------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| Pending | Tan Xiao Ming | NA       | Tan Xiao Ming |

## Situation

## Background

## Assessment

## Recommendation
```

If a proposal is approved, the driver has the responsibility to implement it.
