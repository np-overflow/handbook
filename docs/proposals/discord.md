## Situation

There are too many WhatsApp chats - one is created for every batch and the maintenance of it is high:

* Workshop announcements need to be sent to at least 3 chats
* It is hard to keep track of alumni, or even members

In giant WhatsApp chats such as ours (i.e. > 100 members), people generally don't talk and treat it as an "announcement" chat.

## Background

The reasons for having numerous WhatsApp chats is largely historical. For a good period of time, WhatsApp was the defacto for communication within groups.

## Assessment

WhatsApp is no longer a great platform for engaging with the Overflow community. Competitors like Telegram and Discord have continuously added new features like polls, bots, automation, that simply is not possible to do in a WhatsApp chat.

This, combined with the fact that members rarely use the chats, **is not helpful** in our efforts to increase member engagement. We want to have members that are actively participating in Overflow, but we have to provide them the platform.

## Recommendation

I recommend using Discord as the official platform for all things Overflow.

Most of the administrative setup is done, it is more a matter of informing the members, and coming up with a plan for better community outreach.
