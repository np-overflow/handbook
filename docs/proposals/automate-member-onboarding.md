## Situation

We don't really have a process right now to onboard new members. We have a few steps that we need to do manually, but it might not be scalable if we have a lot of new members. It would be good if we can find a way to automate this process so that we can focus on other things.

Before being able to do that, though, we first have to nail down the process of onboarding new members. I don't think it's that much to onboard: just collect some information and then add them to the right channels and groups. Is this all that we need to do, though? Do we need to do more?

## Importance

It's important to have an onboarding process and act on it at least before a major transitional period (i.e., between EXCO batches). I think this can be something to consider for future batches of EXCO, but I think it's somewhat high on our list of priorities.

## Recommendation

Maybe we can look at using Microsoft Forms to collect information from new members, then using something like Power Automate to reach out to them and add them to the right channels and groups. I think this is a good way to start, but we should also consider other options.
