# Roles

The Overflow EXCO has a largely flat hierarchy, meaning that everyone is encouraged to contribute new ideas and work together. The following are the roles in the club, and the responsibilities that come with them. Do **not** assume that these are the only responsibilities of each role — each role will likely need to take on additional responsibilities as the need arises, particularly if the size of the EXCO is small.
