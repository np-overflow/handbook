## P/VP


## Technology

You are expected to be directly involved in the production of all the various events that go on throughout the year, be it the weekly workshops or something as major as the [Poly-ITE Olympiad in Informatics](/events/pioi).

- Directly involved in:
  - Weekly workshops
  - Bi-annual bootcamps
  - Major events, i.e. PIOI and ByteHackz
  - Any other tech related events or products throughout your tenure as HOT
- Selection of topics to be covered in weekly workshops during current academic semester

## Operations
Being in operations requires you to communicate with various other departments to help plan and enforce certain operations within events. Managing projects revolving Overflow's day-to-day functions would also require skills such as management of delegating duties, flexibility and conversational skills.

Events you may have heard of include but are not limited to
- PIOI
- ByteHackz
- CCA Fiesta

## Publicity

You are responsible for the management of the clubâ€™s social media platforms - Instagram and Discord. Your responsibility also lies in the creation of Instagram post, posters and other physical and virtual contents used for publicizing and advertising the weekly workshops, bootcamps, and other important events such as ByteHackz and PIOI. You are required to be constantly active on social media and display your skills of content creation and writing to the best of your ability. 

You would need to work together with other Excos in planning and creation of these publicity materials.
