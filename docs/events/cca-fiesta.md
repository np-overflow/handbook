# CCA and SIG Fiesta

A yearly event organised by the NP and ICT respectively to promote and encourage new students (Year 1s) to join CCAs and SIGs. As the first line of contact with prospective Overflow members, it is important to be able to sell Overflow well through the use of engaging and interactive demos and good publicity.

## Tech-Ops

With the CCA and SIG Fiesta, it is important to have projects that are visually appealing to students. Some examples of such projects include the use of:

- robotics;
- interactible content; and
- visually tangible components.

Some past projects used in the CCA and SIG Fiesta include:

- a computer vision demo, featuring hand tracking;
- a robot that moves freely while avoiding colliding with people; and
- a Rubik's cube solver.

## Publicity

The CCA and SIG Fiesta are also usually events where Overflow creates freebies to give away. Examples of freebies produced and given out in the past include:

- stickers;
- namecards; and
- acrylic keychains.

### Ordering goods

When ordering items, make sure to act as fast as possible. Many vendors tend to have lead or production times that range anywhere between a day (usually more expensive) to a week. Make sure that you verify with the vendor how long it takes, and if it matches with the timeline you anticipate.

In the past, Overflow have used and looked into using several vendors, including:

- [Kiasuprint](https://www.kiasuprint.com/) â€” stickers + namecards

### Laser cutting

When available, try to reuse resources or use resources that are already readily available without having to pay for it. An example of this is making the acrylic keychains, if that's something the exco agrees to make. Generally, the process are as follows:

1. Getting the required materials and access to a laser cutter.
   - You usually can get some acrylic boards and access to a cutter at Makers' Academy with the supervision of a staff member. Feel free to consult them on whether it is possible to print with your dimensions before printing.
   - ICT also has a laser cutter located in the Capstone room (adjacent to the e-Garage at 31-05). You must be trained to use it or be under the supervision of an instructor.
2. Create the required template files for the laser cutter to print.
   - These files are usually Adobe Illustrator files that determine what to be cut out on the acrylic board.
   - Depending on the cutter, the width of lines that you want to cut, not engrave, need to be manually tweaked and set (for example, 0.001 mm or 0.003 mm).
   - You may refer to past years to see the Illustrator files they have made.
