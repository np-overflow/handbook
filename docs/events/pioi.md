# Poly-ITE Olympiad in Informatics [PIOI]

PIOI is the flagship external event of Overflow. Here are some key points:

* 4 days of workshops
* 1 day of contest, split across two sessions
* 4 questions, 100 points each

## Registration

The kick off to PIOI starts with the registration. A registration form is prepared and is sent out by the lecturer in charge to the various polytechnics.

A few things must be kept in mind when creating the registration form:

* Participants dietary restrictions
* Participants emergency contacts
* Participants existing health conditions (allergies, etc)
* Has the participant read through and agreed to the T&Cs + Rules?

Being able to confirm these during the registration process will reduce the administrative overhead down the road.

## Workshops

Historically, we provide 4 workshops, spread across 4 days. The workshop content generally remain the same, although the organizers of each iteration are encouraged to make their own enhancements and changes. Importantly, the workshops should focus on covering **basics of doing competitive programming using C++**. It is safe to assume that the audience have little to no knowledge of C++, or competitive programming, and the workshops should be tailored as such.

The workshops held usually cover the topics below:

* Introductions to C++
* Introductions to Data Structures in C++
* Introductions to Algorithms in C++
* Practical workshop

The practical workshop places is a sort of familiarization session for the participants. The intended goal is for them to do any preparation necessary before the actual contest day. Some of the things that could be covered include:

* Setting up their account on the contest platform
* Familiarizing themselves with the computers provided
* Going through practice questions

## Contest

The contest comprises of many components, including:

* Contest platform

### Contest platform

Previously, the contest platform used was [Contest Management System](https://github.com/cms-dev/cms). But it has since been replaced with [DMOJ](https://docs.dmoj.ca), which is a more modern and feature-rich platform.

For historical reasons, the contest platform is still referred to as the "CMS".
